### Project Description:
**_Receiptless_** is a mobile application based on storing receipts and tracking expenses associated with the receipts. The idea came about from the overload of receipts stored in consumer wallets/purses as well as the increasing demand to be more environmentally friendly such as reducing the use of paper in everyday life. Prior to a transaction being completed, there will be two ways of importing the receipt into the application.


The first way will be using OCR (Optical Character Recognition), the user will use the mobile camera to take a picture of the receipt and OCR will be used to process the data and it will be formatted into a receipt. In the case of the OCR not working correctly as a result of bad lighting, faded receipts, poor camera quality etc. there will be a manual input section for the user.


The other way to import the receipt into the application is through scanning a unique QR code presented by the POS (point of sale) in the store. Ideally, in the future we would like to see paperless transactions so we are creating the option to scan the QR code that holds the data of the transaction. The data will be processed and then formatted into a receipt on the application.


Additional features of the app will include expense tracker. This will gather the data from the receipts and will track the users expenses and provide a report to the user. These reports can be categorised into sections such as Business or Personal and then further into Food, Travel, Clothing etc. Another feature will be location services using Google Maps API, this will prompt the user when receipt is scanned asking “Are you in shop location?”. This will allow the user to keep track of the location the receipt is from. Last feature will be a subscription tracker. This will be calendar based and will allow the user to record what date the subscription is charged.
