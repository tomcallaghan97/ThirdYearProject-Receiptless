## 1 Introduction

Welcome to Receiptless. This is an iOS / Android mobile application which assists users in storing their receipts and tracking expenses. Consumers fight the battle of trying to store physical receipts every day. From paper filled wallets to paper filled drawers, this application tries to eliminate this frustrating process for consumers. Another issue that this application targets is the tracking of cash transactions. Consumers use bank statements to track all payments made by card but cannot track their cash payments. ATM withdrawals simply aren't enough to track where the money disappears too.

  

This is an everyday problem for many people and this application is here to help. In this user manual, we will go through the process of storing the receipts and also tracking the expenses. This application uses a number of different processes such as OCR (Optical Character Recognition) and data processing. The application can be used on both android and iOS mobile devices.

  

We are sure that you will find our application both convenient and user-friendly. Please continue reading to learn more about the application and how to get started.

## 2 Getting Started

### 2.1 Sign Up

On the user’s initial startup of the application, they will be prompted with the Sign In screen. From here you may press the “Sign Up” text below the Sign In button.

From here the user must enter the following:

-   A unique Username of their choice
    
-   A password containing at least 1 uppercase character, 1 numeric character and at least 6 characters in length

Here is where the user can complete their sign up after completing the previous screen. Using the unique code sent to their email, they will input both their chosen username and the confirmation code sent to them, to confirm and validate the user’s Receiptless account sign up. After entering both fields the “Confirm” button will turn a blue colour and allow you to press it. If the user has entered the correct username and confirmation combination, their sign up will be complete and the user can proceed back to the Sign In screen to login to their newly created

A bezier line chart is the first that is shown, this displays the expenses for the current week (Monday-Friday).
